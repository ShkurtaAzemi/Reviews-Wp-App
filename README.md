# Reviews Plugin

Reviews is a plugin that fetches data from an external API and presents them in a table in the homepage of the theme.

## Usage

After logging in, the administrator has access on the Plugin Settings page that can be found under Settings->Toplist Reviews App. The table header background color and labels are dynamic and they can be managed from there.

After setting a page as the front page of the web application, the data will show automatically in frontend.
